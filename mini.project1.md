# Rock Paper Scissors Game

Welcome to the Rock Paper Scissors game! This is a simple Python project where you can play the classic game against the computer.

## Introduction

Rock Paper Scissors is a hand game usually played between two people, where each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with their hand. The possible shapes are "rock" (a fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index and middle fingers together forming a V). The outcome of the game is determined by the chosen shapes: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.

## How to Play

To play the game, simply run the Python script and follow the prompts to choose your move (rock, paper, or scissors). The computer will randomly select its move, and the winner of the round will be determined based on the rules of the game.

## Features
